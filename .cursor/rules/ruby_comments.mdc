When writing or modifying Ruby code:

1. Comments and Documentation
- All comments MUST be written in English
- Use YARD documentation style for methods and classes
- Include @param and @return tags for method documentation
- Keep comments clear and concise

2. Documentation Examples:

Good:
```ruby
# Create a new component instance
# @param props [Hash] Component properties
def initialize(props = {})
  # Initialize component state
  @state = {}
end
```

3. Documentation Requirements:
- Document all public methods
- Include type information for parameters and return values
- Use descriptive English names for methods and variables
- Add context when the code's purpose isn't immediately clear
